## BinBash Overview

Welcome to BinBash, an **Inventory Management System** designed to streamline your stock control processes. 
BinBash offers a simple and lightweight solution that makes managing your items fast and efficient, 
thus allowing you more time to focus on your other business needs.
It's built to handle the complexities of inventory tracking so that you don't have to. 

Through BinBash, you can **add**, as well as **track** a variety of items that are present in your inventory. 
If necessary, you can also **delete** these items if they are no longer present.
BinBash also **alerts** you when the quantities of items are running low in your inventory, and allows you to **restock** these items when required.
Furthermore, if items are **sold**, BinBash tracks the sale of these items and generates a **profit analysis**, 
thus providing you with valuable insight on the sales velocity of items in your inventory!

This guide will walk you through each feature, providing clear instructions and examples to ensure that you 
can make the most out of BinBash. Let's get your inventory organized efficiently and effectively!
